# Overview
# This GitHub Action manages actions to be taken upon the merging of pull requests. 
# It triggers automatically upon the merging of a pull request into the main branch, 
# facilitating streamlined post-merge processes such as deployment.

# Example:
# 1. Mark PR with releaseAfterMerge tag
# 2. Provide short description in description of the PR (instead of template)
# 3. Build will be sended to Play Store/TestFlight with provided description for internal testing
